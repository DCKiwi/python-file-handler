### What is contained in the repository and the ZIP folder?

The program is all contained in mybackup.py.

Individual functions and scripts are also contained in the zipfolder submitted to stream and in the repository.

However, except for HasherMod.py which we import and use in the main program, the rest of the files are only there for illustrative and marking purposes.

### How to Run the Program?

The program mybackup.py is run through the command line. But you first have to navigate to the working directory where the program is located.

We use the Python3 command to run mybackup.py.

For Example when you type in the command line: "python3 mybackup.py" you will receive a list of commands that you can use to do different things with the program.

One such command is 'init'. This initializes the program. To do this type: "python3 mybackup.py init". The program will run and create the Archive Directory.

Other commands are also run in the same way.

Some commands require further user inputs, for example to store files from a directory, type:
"python3 mybackup.init store". You will then be prompted to type in the directory in the format: "~/Desktop/foo".

Typing this will run the store program and store all files in foo folder into the archive objects directory. It will also serialize these backups into index.txt.

All the other commands run in the same manner. A list is provided when you run "python3 mybackup.py" in the command line.

**We made sure that all requirements in the instructions of the assignment have been met, any additions or bonus features are there for the sake of design choice or completion.**
